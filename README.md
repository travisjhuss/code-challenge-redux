Follow the steps below to complete the code challenge:

[x]1. Create a \<button> element on the DOM, you may do this in jQuery, or write it directly in the HTML code. Have the button text read "Generate".

[x]2. Using jQuery, append a \<div> element when you click the button. It should append a new div each time you click the button.

[x]3. Inside the \<div>\ element you created in the previous step, create a \<p> element that shows how many times you have clicked the "Generate" button from the first step. It should reflect the count for that step - the first div you made should be 1, the second 2, etc.

[x]4. Inside the \<div> element created in step two, append two \<button> elements with text of "Yellow" & "Delete".

[x]5. In a CSS file, any \<div> created using the "Generate" button should start with red as it's background-color.

[ ]6. Clicking a "Yellow" \<button> should change its parent background-color from red to yellow.

[ ]7. Clicking a "Delete" \<button> should remove its parent \<div> and that \<div>s children (including the clicked on "Delete" button).
